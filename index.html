			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher">A <strong>teacher</strong></a>, also called a schoolteacher or formally an educator, is a <em>person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence or virtue.
			Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a specific task). In some countries,
			teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal setting, such as within the family (homeschooling),
			rather than in a formal setting such as a school or college. Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor).</em>
			In most countries, formal teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers.
			This article focuses on those who are employed, as their main role, to teach others in a formal education context,
			such as at a school or other place of initial formal education or training.

		<hr />
		<p> A teacher's role may vary among cultures. Teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy, craftsmanship or vocational training, the arts, religion, civics,
			 community roles, or life skills. Formal teaching tasks include preparing lessons according to agreed curricula, giving lessons, and assessing pupil progress. A
			 teacher's professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching. Outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips, supervise study halls,
			 help with the organization of school functions, and serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities. In some education systems, teachers may be responsible for
			 student discipline.

		<hr />
		<p>Teaching is a highly complex activity.[2] This is partially because teaching is a social practice, that takes place in a specific context (time, place, culture, 
			socio-political-economic situation etc.) and therefore is shaped by the values of that specific context.[3] Factors that influence what is expected (or required) 
			of teachers include history and tradition, social views about the purpose of education, accepted theories about learning, etc.[4] Competences The competences 
			required by a teacher are affected by the different ways in which the role is understood around the world. Broadly, there seem to be four models: the teacher as 
			manager of instruction; the teacher as caring person; the teacher as expert learner; and the teacher as cultural and civic person.[5] The Organisation for Economic 
			Co-operation and Development has argued that it is necessary to develop a shared definition of the skills and knowledge required by teachers, in order to guide teachers' 
			career-long education and professional development.[6] Some evidence-based international discussions have tried to reach such a common understanding. For example, the 
			European Union has identified three broad areas of competences that teachers require: Working with others Working with knowledge, technology and information, 
			and Working in and with society.[7] Scholarly consensus is emerging that what is required of teachers can be grouped under three headings: knowledge 
			(such as: the subject matter itself and knowledge about how to teach it, curricular knowledge, knowledge about the educational sciences, psychology, assessment etc.) 
			craft skills (such as lesson planning, using teaching technologies, managing students and groups, monitoring and assessing learning etc.) and dispositions 
			(such as essential values and attitudes, beliefs and commitment).[8] It has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students 
			can create a positive learning experience.[9] These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to invigorate their teaching of the course materials every day.[10] 
			Teachers who cover the same curriculum repeatedly may find it challenging tomaintain their enthusiasm, lest their boredom with the content bore their students in turn. 
			Enthusiastic teachers are rated higher by their students than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials.[11]Recent research has found a correlation between 
			 teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom.[12] Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of 
			 college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial 
			 expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn.[13] But even while a teacher's enthusiasm has been shown to improve 
			 motivation and increase task engagement, it does not necessarily improve learning outcomes or memory for the material.[14] There are various mechanisms by which teacher 
			 enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation.[15] Teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere of energy and enthusiasm which feeds 
			 student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter.[16] Enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning 
			 process. The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of 
			 learning. Also, enthusiasm may act as a "motivational embellishment", increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's 
			 presentation of the material. Finally, the concept of emotional contagion may also apply: students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm 
			 and energy of the teacher.[12] Interaction with learners Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher 
			 relationships. Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments 
			 that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students.[17][18][19][20] Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial 
			 in linking academic success with personal achievement.[21] Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving themselves, whereas academic success includes 
			 the goals they receive from their superior. A teacher must guide their student in aligning their personal goals with their academic goals. Students who receive this 
			 positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.[20][22][23] Students are likely 
			 to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers.[21][22] Teachers that spend 
			 more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers. Effective teachers have been shown to invite student 
			 participation and decision making, allow humor into their classroom, and demonstrate a willingness to play.[18]
